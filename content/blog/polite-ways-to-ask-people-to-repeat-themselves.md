在英語交流中遇到各種口音，如印度腔等，可能使我們難以理解對方的話。本文將教您在聽不懂時如何禮貌地請對方重複一次，提升溝通效果。

遇到帶有腔調很難懂的英文，例如：印度腔，該如何解決呢？除了平常訓練自己的聽力之外，另外一個很重要的技巧就是：當聽不懂的時候，要請對方再重複一次。

原因是：溝通要能夠順利，雙方都需要負起責任，如果對方有腔調或講太快讓你聽不懂，對方需要負責用你能夠理解的方式表達，而你則是要負起問問題的責任，有禮貌地讓對方知道你不懂並且需要對方的協助。

那麽，要如何有禮貌地請對方再重複一次呢？這篇文章整理了各種有禮貌地請對方再說一次的英文用語，學會了之後應該可以讓溝通更加順利。

## 常用的請求重複表達方式

### Sorry?

Sorry? 是最簡單的問法。記得語氣要上揚。

### Pardon?/I beg your pardon?

Pardon? 是有禮貌的問法，而 I beg your pardon? 則是更有禮貌的問法，但語氣不對的話也可能表現出諷刺的態度，沒把握的話盡量不要亂用。

* Pardon?
* I beg your pardon?

### What was that?

What was that? 類似 What? 但更有禮貌一點。可以加上 Sorry 聽起來會更有禮貌。

* What was that?
* What was that, sorry?
* Sorry, what was that?

### What did you (just) say?

What did you say? 可以暗示對方重新講一次。可加上 just 表示想知道的部分是剛剛說過的話。

* What did you say?
* What did you say, sorry?
* Sorry, what did you say?
* Sorry, what did you just say?
* What did you say just then?

發音小訣竅: just say 的發音是 "jus-say"，just then 是 "jus-then"，t 省略不發音。

### I didn't (quite) catch/get that.

Catch 跟 get 在這裡是聽到並理解的意思。可用在聽不清楚/聽不懂的兩種情境。可加上 quite 表示部分了解、部分不了解。

* Sorry, I didn't catch that.
* Sorry, I didn't get that.
* Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
* Sorry, I didn't quite get that.
* Sorry, I didn't quite catch that last part.

### I'm not following what you're saying.

I'm not following what you're saying 表示你不懂並且暗示對方講慢一點或是換個方式講，讓你比較容易理解。

* I’m not following what you’re saying.
* Sorry, I'm not following what you're saying.

### Wait a second - I'm a bit lost.

I'm a bit lost 告訴對方你不懂並且暗示對方講慢一點或換個方式表達。

* Sorry, I'm a bit lost.
* Wait a second - I'm a bit lost.

### I missed that.

I missed that 是沒聽懂的另外一種講法。

* Sorry, I missed that.
* Would you mind repeating yourself? I missed the last bit.

### I’m not sure I heard correctly.

I’m not sure I heard correctly 是沒聽懂的另外一種委婉講法。

* I’m not sure I heard correctly. Could you repeat the question, please?
* I’m not sure I heard the last part correctly. You were saying that he wanted to quit his job?

### Could you say that again?

Could you say that again? 是明確要求對方重新說一次的講法，可以加入 please 變得更有禮貌。也可以加上 I don't understand 直接讓對方知道你不懂。

* Could you say that again?
* Could you say that again please?
* I don't understand. Could you say that again?
* I don't understand. Could you say that again please?
* I don't understand. Please could you say that again?

## 如何釐清不明確的表達

### I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ...

如果你只有特定部分不了解，那你可以試著用 I'm not sure what you mean by ... 去詢問特定的部分。

* I'm not sure what you mean by ...
* I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ...

### Would you mind slowing down a bit?

如果對方真的講太快，would you mind slowing down a bit 可以明確的要求對方講慢一點。

* Would you mind slowing down a bit? I'm struggling to follow.

### I'm sorry to interrupt, but ...

如果需要打斷對方問問題可以用 I'm sorry to interrupt, but ... (could you say that again?/would you mind ...?/I am not sure what you mean by...?/等問句)

### Would you mind speaking up a bit?

Would you mind speaking up a bit 可用在因為音量的關係聽不清楚的情況。Speak up 表示希望對方提高音量。

* Sorry, would you mind speaking up a bit?

### Could you tell me again ... ?

Could you tell me again 用於詢問之前對話已經講過的事情

* Could you tell me again why you chose to move to Germany?
* I know you already mentioned this, but could you tell me again how they met?

## 如何在多次重複後仍然禮貌地要求對方再說一次

如果你問了一次還是聽不懂，就有可能需要問第二次。以下是問第二次的範例：

* Sorry, one more time, please.
* Sorry, I missed that again. Could you repeat that one more time, please?
* I’m so sorry. The noise is making it difficult for me to hear you. Could you say that again?
